<h1>Here’s how it works.</h1>


# Step 1:
The base URL is https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ModeSolutionsSandbox/Mode-Enablement-CDN/

# Step 2
Append that URL with the path to the file you want to access in the project. For example, for the circular Green Mode Logo un the   ASssets folder. o the DEWN , the JavaScript file is located in the /dist directory. You’d use this. 

# Example:
html <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ModeSolutionsSandbox/Mode-Enablement-CDN/Mode+Analytics_-)_Circle_Logo_-_Green.png.js"></script><.h1>
