Here’s how it works.

The base URL is https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/{username}/{repo}/, where you replace {username} with the GitHub username and {repo} with the repository name for the project.
Append that URL with the path to the file you want to access in the project. For example, for my Atomic XHR plugin, the JavaScript file is located in the /dist directory. You’d use this. html <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/atomic/dist/atomic.js"></script>
